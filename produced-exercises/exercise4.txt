Using the Java programming language I brute forced this, using the same method as 
exercise 3 but generating random keys of length 4,5 and 6. Again, this took a while
as there are 26^4 + 26^5 + 26^6 combinations of keys and my code could produce 
duplicates, taking around 3 times the amount of time as exercise 3. I looped until
the produced plain text contained more than ~50 words from the 100 most common
english words.
