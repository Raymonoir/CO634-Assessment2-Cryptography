Using the Java programming language, I first found the number of rows used in the 
transposition cipher. I then looped through each character of the cipher text and
appended each character to an array (of length rows), the index of the array which
is appended to is found by : array index = cipher text index * rows. I then used a 
while loop and shuffled numbers 0-5 representing the order of the columns I would 
take characters from. I then produced the plain text by looping through each string
in the produced array, appending each character in the string in the order produced
from the random shuffle. The while loop continued until more than ~50 of the top 100
common english words were found in the produced plain text.
