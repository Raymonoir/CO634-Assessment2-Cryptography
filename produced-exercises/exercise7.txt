Using the Java programming language I first analysed the frequencies of each character 
in the plain text and the cipher text by looping through each and counting each character. 
This was not as accurate as I would have liked and only the top 4-5 characters for each
where correctly associated with one another. I then used a bit of brute force by hand
and had my program output two tables of characters and frequencies for both the cipher
text and plain text. I then created a function which would recieve two arrays of 
characters and the cipher text, swapping out each character found in the cipher text from
one array with the character in the same index in the other array. ie [A,B C], [X,Y,Z]
where every A would be swapped with an X. Any character that was not accounted for in the
array would be swapped with a '_'. I would then slowly go through the frequencies, comparing
them and trying adding simliar frequency characters to the swap arrays until more words were
formed, repeating this until the entire cipher text was readable.
